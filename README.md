I found this project very stressfull, I was very overwhelmed with finals and was also coping with the realisation that I don't have a lot of projects to put on a portfolio. I still decided that an outline of a portfolio site would be good to have so I have a place to put my projects and also will be motivated to do more to add more to the porfolio. I had a feature in works section where I would have circles that would expand into revealing the project and it's description, but it ended up being to much for me to implement. I wanted to keep the same themes from the buiseness card so I can use my code from the card as a feature. It was still a lot of work to transfer the code over, because I made it too messy the first time. The parts I had the most diffuculty with would be arranging everything, the elements in the works section wouldn't allign the same way, and I a lot of trouble with re sizing for the contact section. There are working links that download my resume and take you to the survay page. Overall, I found this project to be pretty fun, around the beggening none of the sections tied together, so I spent a good amount of time making sure everything fit into the same overall theme.
